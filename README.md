The repository contains two data sets: 
- some preliminary data (Figure 2 in the paper) to test our design manipulating the amount of dissolved oxygen. Here, we removed O2 using nitrogen gas, and followed the recovery of DO in the head and liquid phases when the system was closed, open or specific amount of aire added.
