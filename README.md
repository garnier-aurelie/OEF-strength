This repository contains the **R** script and the data to analyse a study published in *Ecology and Evolution*:
"Manipulating the strength of organism-environment feedback increases nonlinearity and apparent hysteresis of ecosystem response to environmental change."

The repository contains two data sets (and the metadata): 
- some preliminary data (Figure 2 in the paper) to test our design manipulating the amount of dissolved oxygen. Here, we removed O2 using nitrogen gas, and followed the recovery of DO in the head and liquid phases when the system was closed, open or specific amount of aire added.
- the data **FeedbackStrengthManipulation.csv** (microcosm ID with the qualititative explanatory variable (gas treatment), the quantitative explanatory variable (temperature) and  the quantitative response variables (DO, densities, total biomass)

- the **R script** with two parts: **1)** the minimal ecosystem model, and **2)** the analyses of the experiment.
