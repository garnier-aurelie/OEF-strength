$microcosm		identity of the microcosm (101 to 130 - used for recording the oxygen concentration)
$gas			gas treatment; a factor with 5 levels: "Open", "200mL", "100mL", "50mL" and "Closed"  - ordered according to the increasing feedback strength
$replicate		identity of the replicate (from 1 to 6)
$day			day of the sampling and measurement
$Temperature_H		temperature measured in the head (H) space with the optical-chemical device [Fibox 4trace, PreSens] (in degree celsius)
$Temperature_L		temperature measured in the liquid (L) with the optical-chemical device [Fibox 4trace, PreSens] (in degree celsius)
$Oxygen_H		oxygen concentration in the head space with the optical-chemical device [Fibox 4trace, PreSens] (percentage of oxygen - %O2)
$Oxygen_L		oxygen concentration in the liquid with the optical-chemical device [Fibox 4trace, PreSens] (percentage of oxygen - %O2)
$Density_bacteria	density (individuals per mL) of bacteria estimated from the flow cytometer measurement
$Density_colpidium	density (individuals per mL) of Colpidium striatum (a prey species) estimated from the video analysis
$Density_desxiostoma	density (individuals per mL) of Dexiostoma campylum (a prey species) estimated from the video analysis
$Density_prey		density (individuals per mL) of the two prey species (C. striatum and D. campylum)
$Density_spathidium	density (individuals per mL) of the predator Spathidium sp. counted in 1mL under a dissecting microscope
$Density_cyst 		density (individuals per mL) of the cyst of the predator Spathidium sp. counted in 1mL under a dissecting microscope
$Total_biomass		total biomass (mm3/mL) estimated with the morphological traits (length and width) of the individuals identified in the videos (mostly prey individuals)
